# Instructions

## Start nginx-RTMP server
Streaming node must stream to `rtmp://localhost/live/input`. Output will stream from `rtmp://localhost/live/output`
```sh
docker run -d -p 1935:1935 --name nginx-rtmp tiangolo/nginx-rtmp
```

## Stream video
I streamed using OBS Studio. Change your streaming settings to point to `rtmp://localhost/live` with `input` as the stream key. Ideally this is a direct connection but this was the only way to work on WSL.

## Start IPFS node
I downgraded to 0.7.0 because I had issues with the current version of the Python ipfshttpclient.
```sh
docker run -d --name ipfs_host_0.7.0 -v $ipfs_staging:/export -v $ipfs_data:/data/ipfs -p 4001:4001 -p 4001:4001/udp -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:5001:5001 ipfs/go-ipfs:v0.7.0
```

## Start scripts
```sh
mkdir tmp

# streaming node
./stream_video.py

# client node
./recv/recv_video.py
```
